# Stable Isotope Dynamic Labelling of Secretomes Can Identify Differentially Expressed Secretory Proteins Secreted from Normal and Cancerous Oesophageal cells


## Overview
This study aimed to analyse two stable isotope dynamic labelling of secretomes (SIDLS)-based Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry-derived quantitative proteomic datasets of secreted proteins from a normal and cancerous oesophageal cell. We aimed to demonstrate that SIDLS is effective for distinguishing the secretory pathway of secreted proteins in cells.
