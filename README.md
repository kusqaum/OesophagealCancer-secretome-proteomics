# Stable Isotope Dynamic Labelling of Secretomes Can Identify Differentially Expressed Secretory Proteins Secreted from Normal and Cancerous Oesophageal cells


## Overview
The protein component of the secretome is composed of the whole set of proteins secreted from cells into the extracellular space. Most proteins from the secretome are secreted via classical secretion, and typically contain an N-terminal signal peptide. Other proteins that make up the secretome are secreted via non-classical secretion routes (for example unconventional protein secretion or are 'leaked' intracellular proteins).   
This study aimed to analyse two stable isotope dynamic labelling of secretomes (SIDLS)-based Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-derived quantitative proteomic datasets of secreted proteins from a normal and cancerous oesophageal cell to identify differentially expressed proteins as potential protein biomarkers of oesophageal cancer.   
We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the SIDLS approach in identifying the secretory pathway of secreted proteins using computational tools. Proteins in the cancer secretome were secreted more readily via unconventional protein secretion than classical secretion.  We also found that classically secreted proteins acquire heavy labelling and are secreted most rapidly while intracellular ‘leaked’ proteins acquire heavy labelling and are secreted at the slowest rate.
